# The Globals Editor

Globals Editor is a program that helps you work with the Globals file for The Hobbit (2003) game. It is written in C++ using ImGui. It makes it easy to work with the globals file without any errors.

## Usage

You need to get the decompiled globals file (in TXT format) and upload it to the globals editor. All the changes you made in the file while working in the globals editor will already be in the file.
